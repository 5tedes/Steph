Dear [Support / Account / Management Team],

We are formally escalating the outage affecting www.aigaia.com.cy on 19 January 2026 (approximately 10:00–12:03 Cyprus time) and requesting a full incident review.

Our post-incident technical analysis indicates that the outage was not caused by client-side DNS caching, as initially suggested, but is consistent with a reactive DNS or backend infrastructure correction. Key findings include:
	•	DNS A record currently resolves globally to 181.214.31.81
	•	DNS TTL observed post-incident was approximately 5 minutes, indicative of a recent change
	•	No IPv6 (AAAA) records are present
	•	TLS certificate has been valid since 10 December 2025, ruling out a new deployment or certificate reissue during the incident
	•	Service restoration aligned with resolver cache refresh timing, not local DNS flushing

In addition to the technical cause, we have serious concerns regarding service management:
	•	The outage was detected by our staff, not by your monitoring systems
	•	No proactive alerts or notifications were issued
	•	Initial diagnosis was incorrect and unsupported by evidence
	•	No written incident report or timeline has been provided

These gaps fall below accepted industry standards for managed hosting services.

We therefore request the following:
	1.	A written root-cause analysis and timeline for the incident
	2.	Confirmation of all DNS, hosting, or infrastructure changes made on 19 Jan 2026
	3.	Details of monitoring and alerting in place for our services
	4.	A copy of the applicable SLA, including uptime and response commitments
	5.	Uptime statistics for the past 12 months
	6.	Clarification of any service credits or compensation applicable to this outage
	7.	Confirmation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence

We consider this escalation necessary to ensure service reliability and accountability going forward and expect a management-level response.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
