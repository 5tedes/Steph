  <h2>Formal Escalation – Website Outage (English)</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Dear <strong>[Support / Account / Management Team]</strong>,</p>

    <p>
      We are formally escalating the outage affecting
      <strong>www.aigaia.com.cy</strong> on <strong>19 January 2026</strong>
      (approximately <strong>10:00–12:03 Cyprus time</strong>)
      and requesting a full incident review.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our post-incident technical analysis indicates that the outage
      was not caused by client-side DNS caching, as initially suggested,
      but is consistent with a reactive DNS or backend infrastructure correction.
      Key findings include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>DNS A record currently resolves globally to <strong>181.214.31.81</strong></li>
      <li>DNS TTL observed post-incident was approximately <strong>5 minutes</strong>, indicative of a recent change</li>
      <li>No IPv6 (AAAA) records are present</li>
      <li>
        TLS certificate has been valid since <strong>10 December 2025</strong>,
        ruling out a new deployment or certificate reissue during the incident
      </li>
      <li>
        Service restoration aligned with resolver cache refresh timing,
        not local DNS flushing
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to the technical cause, we have serious concerns regarding service management:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The outage was detected by our staff, not by your monitoring systems</li>
      <li>No proactive alerts or notifications were issued</li>
      <li>Initial diagnosis was incorrect and unsupported by evidence</li>
      <li>No written incident report or timeline has been provided</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These gaps fall below accepted industry standards for managed hosting services.
    </p>

    <p>
      We therefore request the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>A written root-cause analysis and timeline for the incident</li>
      <li>Confirmation of all DNS, hosting, or infrastructure changes made on 19 January 2026</li>
      <li>Details of monitoring and alerting in place for our services</li>
      <li>A copy of the applicable SLA, including uptime and response commitments</li>
      <li>Uptime statistics for the past 12 months</li>
      <li>Clarification of any service credits or compensation applicable to this outage</li>
      <li>Confirmation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We consider this escalation necessary to ensure service reliability
      and accountability going forward and expect a management-level response.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kind regards,<br>
      <strong>[Your Name]</strong>
    </p>
