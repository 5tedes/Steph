<h1>Incident Report: Website Outage – www.aigaia.com.cy</h1>

<h2>1. Incident Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 19 January 2026<br>
<strong>Timezone:</strong> Cyprus (EET)<br>
<strong>Affected Service:</strong> www.aigaia.com.cy<br>
<strong>Hosting Model:</strong> Managed hosting (third-party provider)</p>

<p>
On 19 January 2026, the website <strong>www.aigaia.com.cy</strong> experienced an unplanned service outage during business hours.
The issue was first identified internally by staff and not by the hosting provider.
Service was restored approximately two hours later.
</p>

<p>
Post-incident technical analysis indicates that the outage was most likely caused by a
<strong>reactive DNS or upstream routing correction</strong>,
rather than a client-side DNS cache issue as initially communicated by the hosting provider.
</p>

---

<h2>2. Timeline of Events</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>~10:00</strong> – Staff report inability to access www.aigaia.com.cy</li>
  <li><strong>10:00–11:05</strong> – Hosting provider notified; no proactive alert from provider monitoring</li>
  <li><strong>11:05</strong> – Provider attributes issue to local DNS cache; attempts remote DNS flush on a workstation (unsuccessful due to permissions)</li>
  <li><strong>11:30</strong> – Provider claims issue has been fixed</li>
  <li><strong>12:03</strong> – Website becomes accessible internally and externally</li>
  <li><strong>Post-incident</strong> – DNS, TLS, and HTTP-layer diagnostics performed</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>3. Technical Findings</h2>

<h3>3.1 DNS Resolution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A record resolves globally to <strong>181.214.31.81</strong></li>
  <li>Observed TTL post-incident: <strong>~5 minutes</strong></li>
  <li>No AAAA (IPv6) record present</li>
  <li>DNS resolution currently consistent across all regions</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
A very low TTL is characteristic of a <strong>recent or reactive DNS change</strong>,
rather than a long-standing stable configuration.
This aligns with emergency troubleshooting or rollback activity.
</p>

---

<h3>3.2 TLS / SSL Configuration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Certificate valid from: <strong>10 December 2025</strong></li>
  <li>Issuer: Let’s Encrypt (R12)</li>
  <li>No certificate reissue or renewal on the incident date</li>
  <li>TLS configuration rated <strong>Grade A</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The hosting endpoint and application stack existed prior to the incident.
The outage was not caused by a new deployment, server rebuild, or TLS reconfiguration.
</p>

---

<h3>3.3 HTTP / Application Layer Verification</h3>

<p>
A post-recovery HTTP header inspection was performed using:
</p>

<pre>
curl -I https://aigaia.com.cy
</pre>

<p><strong>Observed response:</strong></p>

<pre>
HTTP/2 301
server: LiteSpeed
x-powered-by: PHP/5.6.40
x-redirect-by: WordPress
location: https://www.aigaia.com.cy/
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
This confirms that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The web server (LiteSpeed) was operational</li>
  <li>PHP was executing successfully</li>
  <li>WordPress was running and issuing a normal canonical redirect</li>
</ul>

<p>
This conclusively rules out:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Application failure</li>
  <li>Web server downtime</li>
  <li>Broken virtual host configuration</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>4. Root Cause Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Most likely cause:</strong></p>

<p>
A <strong>reactive DNS A-record change or upstream routing/backend correction</strong>
performed after the outage began, pointing traffic back to an already running server.
</p>

<p><strong>Causes not supported by evidence:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Client-side DNS cache failure</li>
  <li>IPv6 misconfiguration</li>
  <li>TLS or certificate issues</li>
  <li>Application or server crash</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>5. Service Management & Process Failures</h2>

<p>
Regardless of whether the change was reactive or planned, the following deficiencies were identified:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No proactive monitoring:</strong> The provider did not detect or alert on the outage</li>
  <li><strong>Incorrect initial diagnosis:</strong> Client-side DNS cache blamed without evidence</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of communication:</strong> No incident notification or updates</li>
  <li><strong>No post-incident reporting:</strong> No written RCA or timeline provided</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy environment indicators:</strong> PHP 5.6 (end-of-life) suggests weak operational hygiene</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>6. Impact</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Loss of website availability during business hours</li>
  <li>Operational disruption</li>
  <li>Reputational risk</li>
  <li>Internal time spent on investigation and escalation</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>7. Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Implement provider-side external uptime monitoring with alerting</li>
  <li>Define and enforce a formal SLA with uptime and response guarantees</li>
  <li>Require advance notice for planned changes and post-incident reports for outages</li>
  <li>Review suitability of current hosting provider for critical services</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The outage of www.aigaia.com.cy on 19 January 2026 was resolved through a reactive technical correction.
However, the absence of proactive monitoring, incorrect diagnosis, and lack of formal incident handling
represent a broader service delivery failure inconsistent with managed hosting best practices.
</p>

<p>
Corrective actions and contractual clarification are required to restore confidence in the service.
